    "## Introduction & Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to develop a working model for solving the core Facial Keypoints Detection problem. At a high level, Facial Keypoints Detection is a task where given a image of a human face, a model analyzes the image and detects facial keypoints for the identified face. Such facial keypoints include the centers and corners of the eyes, the corners of the mouth, and the tip of the nose, among other facial key points. To accomplish this task, the model must predict coordinates (x, y) in the pixel space of the given image of a face.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a computer vision problem, the Facial Keypoints Detection task has a wide variety of applications. From the basic task of identifying facial keypoints of a given image of a face, these results can be used to solve the task of identifying faces in images (a.k.a. facial recognition). These results then enable solving much more complex problems, including tracking (multiple) faces in videos (such as in security camera footage) and analyzing facial expressions in different faces (emotion understanding, which can be used in sentiment analysis based on camera footage). This technology can even extend to doing more complex biometrics analysis, which is heavily used to identify people simply using an image of their face, such as Microsoft's Face API & Windows Hello and Apple's Face ID for iPhones. Thus, accomplishing the facial keypoints detection task is central to much of the work done in this day and age on basic human understanding in computer vision. "
