Baseline for Final Project
---------------------------
Note: These details were gathered from the Week 9 Live Session

**Due by end of Week 10 (Sunday 11/3/19 11:59PM PST)**

* Create the beginning of an notebook (.ipynb file) (one for entire team)
   - Highlight the problem being solved, and why anyone cares
   - Clarify what's prediction, the data, the model
   - Articulate the ideas you have for the model
   - Articulate how you would go about processing the data in the model
* Want to make sure the problem is understood
* Want to make sure you know how you want to test your approaches
* The baseline will be graded based on submission and effort

**Show up to Week 11 office hours to go through the week 10 baseline submission with Yacov**

** Notes From Week 10 Live Session **
*************************************

Purpose of baseline
 - make sure you're off to a good start
 - make sure there are no surprises at end of semester to do a mad rush
 - there to help Yacov help us to finish successfuly
 
What works really well by this stage, as a team, be sure you've
 - consumed what the problem is
 - understood why should anyone care (what's point of solving this)
 - more details on representation of the problem (in terms of weekly discussion
     - what happens at inferences
     - what's input & output
     - kinds of models to consider
     - kinds of features (feature engineering)
     - how you go about training
     - start doing some EDA
 - don't expect a full detailed solution
 
Submit Baseline by end of week 10, start meeting with Yacov during Week 11 office hours
 
In terms of scientific papers, this baseline submission would be similar to introduction, abstract, & the methods of a paper.
